	<text>
       <p>Arrange the following functions in increasing order of growth rate (with g(n) following f(n) in your list if and only if f(n)=O(g(n))). </p>

       $$ a(n)=n $$

       $$ b(n)= \sqrt{n} $$

       $$ c(n)=n^{2/3} $$

       $$ d(n)=n^5 + n^4 + 3n^2 $$
	
       $$ e(n)=2^n $$

       $$ f(n)=n^4. \log n $$

       $$ g(n)=2^{n^2} $$
   
       $$ h(n)=2^{n^n} $$

        <i>In Big-O Notation, we say f=O(g) which means that "f" grows no faster than "g" if there is a constant c such that \( f(n) \le c.g(n) \). Big-O notation allows us to focus on the big picture. It is important to remember commonsense rules that help simplify functions by ommiting dominated terms as follows: 1- Multiplicative constants can be ommited, 2- \( n^a \) dominates \( n^b \), if \( a>b \), 3- Any exponential dominates polynomial, 4- Any polynomial dominates any logarithm. Using the rules listed before, we can identify the correct order of growth rate, which is: b, c, a, f, d, e, g, h </i>

			Remember that exponential dominates polynomial, so g=O(h), in other words, \( h(n) \)should be following \( g(n) \)in the correct answer

			Remember that exponential dominates polynomial, so f=O(e) and d=O(e), in other words,\( e(n) \) should be following \( f(n) \) and \( d(n) \) in the correct answer.

		<explanation>Try to study the commonsense rules for Big-O Notation again. Note that if, a function "g" grows faster than another function "f", then we have f=O(g). In this situation\( g(n) \) should be following \( f(n) \).
